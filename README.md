## Project Brief
- Build a full-stack application

## Technologies Used

* HTML

## Approach

### Planning
We began our project with a general discussion of our ideas and quickly agreed to make a website we both are interested in -- a property rental website. For having a different niche in the market, we want to create a platform exclusively for uni students searching for a room or roommate in Australia.

So, these are the functions needs to meet the needs

- As a user, I want to add the room for renting 
- As a user, I want to share the amenities the property provides.
- As a user, I want to see the list of the renting room.
- As a user, I want to see the lease date.
